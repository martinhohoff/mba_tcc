    abstract = { This paper demonstrates that combining regression trees with the finite element method (FEM) may be a good strategy for modelling highly non-linear mechanical systems. Regression trees make it possible to model FEM-based non-linear maps for fields of stresses, velocities, temperatures, etc., more simply and effectively than other techniques more widely used at present, such as artificial neural networks (ANNs), support vector machines (SVMs), regression techniques, etc. These techniques, taken from Machine Learning, divide the instance space and generate trees formed by submodels, each adjusted to one of the data groups obtained from that division. This local adjustment allows good models to be developed when the data are very heterogeneous, the density is very irregular, and the number of examples is limited. As a practical example, the results obtained by applying these techniques to the analysis of a vehicle axle, which includes a preloaded bearing and a wheel, with multiple contacts between components, are shown. Using the data obtained with FEM simulations, a regression model is generated that makes it possible to predict the contact pressures at any point on the axle and for any condition of load on the wheel, preload on the bearing, or coefficient of friction. The final results are compared with other classical linear and non-linear model techniques. }

abstract = {Any of a theoretical constitutive model all needs to be characterized by proper experimental stress–strain relations to describe material behaviors in the domain of plastic deformation. It means that regression of experimental data by a suitable equation would be the most fundamental work. Some empirical equations currently used in engineering cannot always reproduce experimental stress–strain relations acceptably, particularly for experiments dealing with complex stress states and multi-experimental stress–strain relations. To improve the accuracy of numerical analysis, two new constitutive models for regression of various experimental stress–strain relations are suggested. One is simple relatively to another, but the complex one can give a more accurate reproduction of experimental stress–strain relation. Several uniaxial tensions of rolled sheet metals and a hydro-bulging test have been performed. Regressions of these experimental stress–strain relations have been done by two suggested models. Predicting precisions are discussed and compared with power functions. In relation to the uniaxial tension in different loading direction to the rolling, changeable ratios of transverse to through thickness strain-increments are explained, and their influence on the profile of plastic potential is presented.}

abstract = {Condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings (REBs) are at present very important to ensure the steadiness of industrial and domestic machinery. According to the non-stationary and non-linear characteristics of REB vibration signals, feature extraction method is based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD) energy entropy in this paper. A mathematical analysis to select the most significant intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) is presented. Therefore, the chosen features are used to train an artificial neural network (ANN) to classify bearings defects. Experimental results indicated that the proposed method based on run-to-failure vibration signals can reliably categorize bearing defects. Using a proposed health index (HI), REB degradations are perfectly detected with different defect types and severities. Experimental results consist in continuously evaluating the condition of the monitored bearing and thereby detect online the severity of the defect successfully. This paper shows potential application of ANN as effective tool for automatic bearing performance degradation assessment without human intervention.}
